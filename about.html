        <p>I started working on this blog as a student of the BCIT New Media Web Design and Development program. As a frontend developer in Blinkloader.com, Inc. I was facing loads of new professional information generated by different sources every day. Yet I felt that it still lacked structure and comprehensiveness, and did not address some questions. How to do things while working as a frontend developer? How to structure your stylesheets and code so that they remain maintainable? How to properly and on-time use all the tools? What are essential elements of daily created web components, like form validations, accessibility, cross-browser testing, etc?
        </p>
        <p>
        All these topics can overwhelm even a Computer Science graduate, which many of the modern software developers are not. That is why, to make things easier for herself and novices like her, I started this blog. </p>

        <h1>Mission</h1>
        <p>Mission of this blog is to spread best practices in frontend development. It serves  both novices and seasoned professionals. Modern frontend development is a very dynamic and turbulent sphere. Lots of new frameworks, tools, approaches appear every day. And information about them is often chaotic, unstructured and sometimes incomplete.</p>
        <p>This blog  aims to provide structured reviews of tools and workflows, tutorials and guides.  The focus is to help readers to improve their day-to-day working routines and to write clear, maintainable code, CSS and HTML. </p>
        <p>Basically it's my knowledge base.</p>
