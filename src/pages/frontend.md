##What is it?

Simply put front end is the visual part of the web such as the navigation, buttons, link etc. Front-end web development focuses the look, feel and ultimately design of a website. Front-end developers take a design and develop it into a website that works!

Front-end main tools are HTML, CSS, and Javascript. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, a series of  tags that tells the browser how the content of your web pages and applications are structured. It’s the standard markup language used to create webpages. HTML5 allows to make the layouts very clear, introduces elements like date picker and sliders, which previously were possible only with the use of JavaScript. What's more, you can even make games with it and draw complex compositions and animations, e.g. using canvas.

CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, indicate which HTML tags to style and tell what the design of the website. It is another language used to change the appearance of each HTML tag. Using CSS properly often requires constructing a design system, where all elements have consistent styling. You can do very sophisticated visuals, animations and layouts using modern CSS.

Lastly, Javascript is the functional aspect of the web site which takes user input via forms and creates complex animations and visual experiences.
