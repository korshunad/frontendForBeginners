Sometimes you may hear that errors in a developer or a designer work are not as critical as that of a doctor. Such thought may make you feel that web development does not bring value to the world. However, if you like coding and designing, there ways to make the world a better place.

One of the ways as a developer to help the environment is to develop different apps, web portals, marketplaces that make eco-friendly habits easier. Different hackathons provide the opportunity to check your ideas within a limited timeframe. Although many of those events happen in Europe (like <a href="https://climathon.climate-kic.org/en/" title="Climathon" rel="noopener noreferrer">Climathon</a>), there are some events in Canada and the US as well.

Let’s take a look at some of the solutions developers with different levels have built during the past year:
##An Example from Delta Hacks V Hackathon in Hamilton, ON
###Feed the starving kids
Food4Kids website allows potential donors to buy the specific quantities and types of foods the children need.

Built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript

##Example from Girls in tech Hacking for Humanity Hackathon, Vancouver BC

###Prevent Fires

Fireware app provides the fire map that shows where the fires are right now in a particular area, and Twitter feeds for people to get the latest information. It uses AI prediction algorithm based on historical fire data coming from NASA’s satellite images system to estimate the daily chance of fires in the area and provides education on how to provide information about current fires.

##Examples from uwEnergyHacks Hackathon in Waterloo ON

###Make offices cooling and heating usage more energy-efficient

Felix Ai mobile app was built to help the office buildings optimize their energy usage for heating and cooling. Each employee votes for the desired temperature, and then the AI optimizes the temperature in the building based on the votes, historical data, and future predictions.

##Industry examples

An exciting part of frontend development is that many free resources are available, including various APIs. For example, you can leverage advanced capabilities of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning i.e., for image recognition or even image to speech apps. ’That’s why some of the apps above and overall hackathon participants are using AI in their apps quite easily.

Here is a couple of professional applications of the Google Vision API and image recognition used to save endangered species or study and save the ecosystems:
